# Snoozer

This is a [voicecode](https://voicecode.io) package.

This adds one command:

* ðŸ”‰snoozerðŸ”‰

this will pause for 50 milliseconds before continuing. this is intended to be
used in a situation where you might be building a large string of commands in a
single utterance, and you need to deal with the race condition.
